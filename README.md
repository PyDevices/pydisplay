This repository is the examples, integration documentation, and browser gallery
for the PyDevices driver ecosystem. The reusable product source lives in
**[pydevices](https://github.com/PyDevices/pydevices)**:

- `displaydev` and `audiodev` provide portable display and audio interfaces.
- `events`, `keys`, and `multimer` provide shared event, key, and timing primitives.
- `appdev` is an optional application traffic controller for non-LVGL apps.
- `board_configs`, `board_peripherals`, and hardware drivers connect those interfaces
  to real boards and desktop/browser hosts.

Those libraries are designed to work across MicroPython, CircuitPython, and
CPython on microcontrollers, Linux, Windows, Android, browsers, and notebooks.
This repo demonstrates that portability; it is not the package source of truth.

> **Alpha quality.** The organization is being prepared for its first external
> users, so names and APIs may still evolve.

## Try it

The fastest route is the installable
**[PyScript gallery](https://PyDevices.github.io/pydevices-examples/pyscript/)**. It runs
the real examples in a browser and can be installed as a Progressive Web App.
Start a standalone browser app from the
**[pyscript-template](https://github.com/PyDevices/pyscript-template)**,
or use the [PWA guide](https://github.com/PyDevices/pyscript-template/blob/main/docs/pwa-guide.md)
to understand and customize the full gallery shell.

For a desktop clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PyDevices/pydevices-examples.git
cd pydevices-examples
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
  --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ -r requirements.txt
cd lib
../.venv/bin/python examples/pydevices_demo.py
```

On Windows, use the equivalent `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` commands.

For MicroPython, install unprefixed MIP package names from the PyDevices
PyDevices MIP index, then install a board package:

```python
import mip

INDEX = "https://PyDevices.github.io/mip"
mip.install("pydevices", index=INDEX)  # displaydev, appdev, and the rest of lib/
```

See the
[pydevices install workflows](https://github.com/PyDevices/pydevices/blob/main/docs/install-workflows.md)
and [board configs](https://github.com/PyDevices/pydevices/blob/main/docs/board-configs.md)
for complete device setup.

## App ownership

Board configs describe hardware. They export neutral pieces such as
`display_drv`, `touch_read`, `host_read`, and `timer_async`; they do not create
an application-level `appdev.App`.

Non-LVGL examples in this repo opt into the optional `appdev` coordinator:

```python
import board_config
from board_config import display_drv
import appdev

app = appdev.App(board_config)

app.run()
```

LVGL examples use the coordinator bundled with the LVGL binding and do not
import `appdev`:

```python
from board_config import display_drv
from display_driver import app

app.run()
```

This separation keeps hardware policy out of board configs and lets applications
provide a different event loop or traffic controller when appropriate.

## Package names

Python distributions on TestPyPI use the organization prefix; imports and MIP
packages remain conventional and unprefixed. `pydevices` ships all of the core
`lib/` tree as one distribution -- MIP publishes those components separately,
because installing only what a board needs matters there.

| TestPyPI distribution | Python import / MIP name |
|---|---|
| `pydevices` | `displaydev`, `audiodev`, `appdev`, `events`, `keys`, `multimer`, `boarddev` |
| `pydevices-pygraphics` | `pygraphics` |
| `pydevices-palettes` | `palettes` |
| `pydevices-pdwidgets` | `pdwidgets` |
| `pydevices-lvgl` | `lvgl` |
