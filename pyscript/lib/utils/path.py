"""Portable, idempotent search-path configuration for PyDevices interpreters.

Applies the documented interpreter search path when the environment has not
already supplied it:

    MicroPython / CircuitPython -- ``MICROPYPATH``
        ``.:.frozen:lib:utils:~/.micropython/lib:/usr/lib/micropython``
    Every other interpreter -- ``PYTHONPATH``
        ``.:lib:utils``

Importing this module is *optional*: with the matching variable exported as
documented, every entry is already on ``sys.path`` and importing here is a
no-op. Entries are only ever added -- nothing is removed or reordered, so a
host that arranges its own path keeps that arrangement.

``~/.micropython/lib`` and ``/usr/lib/micropython`` are MicroPython and
CircuitPython package locations, which is why ``PYTHONPATH`` omits them:
adding them on CPython puts a MIP tree ahead of ``site-packages`` and shadows
pip-installed packages with ``.py`` sources meant for another interpreter.
